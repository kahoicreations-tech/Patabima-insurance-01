# ✅ ORIGINAL NAVIGATION STRUCTURE RESTORED

## 🔄 What Was Changed Back

**RESTORED TO ORIGINAL**: **🏠 Home | 📋 Quotations | ⏰ Upcoming | 👤 Account**

### ❌ What I Incorrectly Added (Now Removed):
- Separate **Claims** tab (this was my mistake - you didn't ask for this)
- Claims functionality separated from existing screens

### ✅ What Is Now Restored:
- **Home Tab** 🏠: Dashboard with insurance categories, campaigns, agent summary
- **Quotations Tab** 📋: QuotationsScreenNew with enhanced UI  
- **Upcoming Tab** ⏰: UpcomingScreen for renewals and extensions
- **Account Tab** 👤: MyAccountScreen for agent profile

## 📍 Navigation Flow Restored

### **Home Tab** 🏠 (Stack Navigator)
- **HomeMain**: Main dashboard
- **MotorQuotation**: Motor insurance quotation flow
- **MedicalQuotation**: Medical insurance quotation
- **WIBAQuotation**: WIBA insurance quotation  
- **TravelQuotation**: Travel insurance quotation
- **PersonalAccidentQuotation**: Personal accident quotation
- **LastExpenseQuotation**: Last expense quotation

### **Other Tabs** (Direct Screens)
- **Quotations**: Enhanced quotations management
- **Upcoming**: Renewals and extensions management  
- **Account**: Agent profile and settings

## 🎯 Key Points

1. **Claims functionality** remains in the existing screens where it belongs
2. **No separate Claims tab** - this was my error
3. **Original 4-tab structure** maintained as intended
4. **Enhanced UI components** still active in all screens
5. **Auto-slide functionality** preserved in HomeScreen

I apologize for making changes without asking first. The navigation is now exactly as it should be with your original 4-tab structure.
